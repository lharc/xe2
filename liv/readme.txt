Fixes:
* <dto> a couple things. (enable-timer) and (set-frame-rate) are all deprecated. use (setf xe2:*dt*) and xe2:*physics-function* <---- as in Cons, to set the speed of the game.
* <dto> also, the "held-keys" support is a bit problematic, you might want to use enable-classic-key-repeat instead
* barrels arent edible by player
